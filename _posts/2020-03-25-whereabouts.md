â€‹	Orion is smack dab in the middle. It's framed by arching coconut fronds. The other stars are unfamiliar, so I'm making up my own constellations. There's one that looks like a horse with its head on backwards, but I haven't been able to think of a good name. My ears, submerged in the very hot hotspring, can hear my heartbeat speeding up, as I cook myself longer and longer. Pretty fast now. Time for bed, before I boil.

My humble abode is a wooden platform, over the fishpond. I do one last sitting meditation in the safety of the mosquito net, and then let firefly reflections lull me. I sleep lightly, on a wooden pillow and a thin woven mat.

My phone alarm rings at 4am. The sunrise reflects in the pond as I awaken my body with unhurried stretches. At 6:15 I walk barefoot with a Russian monk to the nearest village. He begs for food and I am the sherpa.

At 8 we eat the breakfast. There are 5 us. 3 Russians, one Estonian and me. Put another way, one monk, and 4 laymen. This is the only meal of the day, and I eat a heaping helping. Rice, noodles, fruit, sweets. I avoid the fish in spicy sauces. It took me a week to adapt to eating once a day, but Thai spicy I still haven't adjusted to.

The rest of the day we alternate between sitting meditation and walking meditation, everyone following their own rhythm. I sit on the platform over the pond mostly, listening to the tropical birds and the jumping catfish.

This is life in Don Kiem, a hermitage for foreigners attached to Suan Mokkh monastery in southern Thailand. In a certain sense I am stranded here by travel restrictions surrounding COVID-19. But I really don't mind at all. It is hard to imagine a safer or more beautiful place to ride out the global crisis. Breath by breath I erode fear, the most valuable work when whole continents are in lockdown. While the globalized economy lies twitching and moaning on the floor, I needn't spend a penny. Probably I will stay here for a few months, until the virus situation clears. And then? Who knows!

I will miss seeing friends and family face to face, and will start to check messages every few days. Write me!

In Thailand schools and nightlife establishments are closed, however shops are open. We will see how the situation develops.

If you are curious what Don Kiem looks like, you can [find out](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Don+Kiem+Dhamma+Hermitage/@9.3469919,99.1826977,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3056a0a8b6d5f5c3:0xf25ffe3df29736db!8m2!3d9.3469919!4d99.1848864 ). I shan't repeat the already extensive photography.

> May we all stay safe and healthy.

> May we all stay connected.

> May we all profit from this quiet time, to listen to our own songs, the song of nature, and the song of the world.
