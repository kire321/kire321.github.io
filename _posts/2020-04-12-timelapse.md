The cicadas and fish also performed very enthusiastically, however you can't credit everyone in a short title. In the beginning you hear the night sounds, which in reality go on for hours. In the middle, you hear the famous "dawn chorus," which lasts a few minutes. The end is the day sounds, which also continue much longer in reality. A little splash ends the composition. Enjoy!
